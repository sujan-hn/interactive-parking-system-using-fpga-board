The parking slots are assumed as switches of the board, and the led's corresponding are lit if the switch is turned off(implying the space is empty)
the user can also view the output on the 7 segment display of the board,with a interactive scrolling message, which indicates if the parking space is OPEN or FULL and also indicates the REMAINING AVAILABLE SLOTS to the user
